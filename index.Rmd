title: Analyzing Sanitation Grades in New York City
---
### Data Source
We chose to analyze the DOHMN New York City Restaurant Inspection Results dataset, which includes the sanitation ratings, scores, and infractions for the various restaurants around the city. This dataset is publicly available through NYC Open Data. These data were cleaned and manipulated to be accessible for analysis.

### Analysis
Our initial analysis examined various sanitation rating aspects of restaurants in New York City using [plotly](p8105_hw6_problem1.html). We included a boxplot which displays the score medians for the ten most popular categories of restaurants. Based on the total number of restaurants with a B-Rating in these top ten categories, a donut graph was created to display the proportion of restaurants that each category contributed. Finally, a bar-chart was used to display the number of critical and non-critical infractions by inspection grade and also by borough.

### Shiny Dashboard
We then constructed an interactive Shiny dashboard to allow the user to control certain aspects of the [data analysis](https://kblitsman.shinyapps.io/p8105_hw6_problem2/). Specifically, the user is allowed to select the desired grade and date range of the restaurant inspection. The three included graphs update appropriately when such changes are made.
