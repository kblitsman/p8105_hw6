title: Analyzing Sanitation Grades in New York City
---
### Data
We chose to analyze the New York Restaurant Inspection Result data set, which includes the sanitiation ratings, scores, and infractions for the various restaurants around the city. 

### Analysis
We initially examined various sanitation rating aspects of restaurants in New York City using [plotly](p8105_hw6_kb2908.html).

###Shiny Dashboard
We then constructed an interative Shiny dashboard to allow the user to control certain aspects of the [data analysis](https://kblitsman.shinyapps.io/p8105_hw6_problem2/).
